## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

### The 80/20 Rule
```
80% of your time → BUILDING projects
20% of your time → Learning concepts
```

### Project-Based Learning
```
Don't:
❌ Watch 10-hour tutorial
❌ Read entire documentation
❌ Try to learn everything first

Do:
✅ Pick a project
✅ Build it immediately
✅ Learn what you need as you go
✅ Ship it to production
```

### Iterative Improvement
```
Version 1: Make it work (ugly but functional)
Version 2: Make it right (clean code)
Version 3: Make it fast (optimized)
```
