## 💡 Golden Rules

1. **Build > Learn** — Learn just enough, then build
2. **Deploy Everything** — Live URLs beat local projects
3. **Show Metrics** — "Reduced latency by 60%" > "Made it faster"
4. **Modern Stack** — Use 2025 tech (Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript)
5. **Consistency** — 2 hours/day beats 14 hours on weekend
6. **Network** — Connect with 5 people/week on LinkedIn
7. **Apply Smart** — 5 tailored applications > 50 generic ones

---

## 🚫 Avoid These Mistakes

❌ Tutorial hell (watching without building)
❌ Perfectionism (ship early, iterate)
❌ Too many projects (finish 3 great ones)
❌ No live demos (always deploy)
❌ Generic resume (tailor for each job)
❌ Skipping system design (it's often the bottleneck)
❌ Giving up after rejections (everyone gets rejected)
