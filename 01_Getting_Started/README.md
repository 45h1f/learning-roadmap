## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### The 3 Core Principles

1. **🛠️ Learn by Doing**
   - Don't just watch tutorials - build real projects
   - Break things, fix them, understand why
   - Every tool you learn should have a project attached to it

2. **📊 Depth Over Breadth**
   - Better to know 5 tools deeply than 20 superficially
   - Master the fundamentals before exploring advanced topics
   - Revisit and strengthen core skills regularly

3. **📝 Document Everything**
   - Keep notes on what you learn
   - Write blog posts to solidify knowledge
   - Build a personal knowledge base (use Notion/Obsidian)
