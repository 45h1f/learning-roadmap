## 🎯 Why Negotiation Matters

### The Compound Effect

```text
Scenario: Two developers, same skills

Developer A: Accepts first offer
- Year 1: $100,000
- Year 5: $130,000 (3% annual raises)
- Career earnings (30 years): $4.2M

Developer B: Negotiates $10k more
- Year 1: $110,000
- Year 5: $143,000 (3% annual raises)
- Career earnings (30 years): $4.6M

Difference: $400,000+ over career
Time spent negotiating: 2-3 hours
Hourly rate of negotiating: $133,000+

Every $1,000 you negotiate = $30,000-50,000 over your career
```

### The Harsh Truth

```markdown
## Reality Check

❌ Myth: "If I negotiate, they'll rescind the offer"
✅ Reality: Companies EXPECT you to negotiate. It's budgeted in.

❌ Myth: "I should be grateful for any offer"
✅ Reality: It's a business transaction. They need you too.

❌ Myth: "Negotiating is awkward and uncomfortable"
✅ Reality: Yes. Do it anyway. Discomfort = money.

❌ Myth: "I don't have leverage as a junior"
✅ Reality: They spent $30k+ recruiting you. You have leverage.

❌ Myth: "Women shouldn't negotiate differently"
✅ Reality: Sadly, bias exists. Strategy matters.

Statistics:
- 70% of employers expect negotiation
- Only 37% of candidates negotiate
- Women who negotiate are perceived as "difficult" (unfair but real)
- Solution: Frame asks differently (we'll cover this)
```

### When NOT to Negotiate

```markdown
## Red Flags - Just Take the Offer:

1. You're unemployed for 6+ months
   - Need income stability
   - Can negotiate later (6-12 month review)

2. Offer is already above market rate
   - Research shows you're getting premium
   - Risk alienating employer

3. Small startup, broke, equity-heavy
   - Cash-strapped startups
   - Negotiate equity instead

4. You already pushed back twice
   - Diminishing returns
   - Accept or walk

In all other cases: NEGOTIATE.
```

## 📊 Know Your Worth

### Research Your Market Value

```markdown
## Salary Data Sources (2025)

### Most Accurate
1. **levels.fyi** - Real submitted offers with verification
   - Filter by: Company, Level, Location, YOE
   - See total comp breakdown
   - Most reliable data

2. **Glassdoor Salary Calculator**
   - Large dataset
   - Filter by location and experience
   - Read actual reviews

3. **Blind** (TeamBlind app)
   - Anonymous compensation sharing
   - Tech industry focused
   - Real employees

4. **LinkedIn Salary Insights**
   - Based on member data
   - Good for general ranges

### Supplementary
5. **Payscale** - Broad data, less tech-specific
6. **Indeed Salary Estimator** - Job posting data
7. **H1B Salary Database** - Public H1B filings (minimum they pay)
8. **Your Network** - Ask people directly

### How to Research

Step 1: Gather 10+ data points
Step 2: Calculate ranges:
- Low (25th percentile)
- Mid (50th percentile - median)
- High (75th percentile)

Step 3: Adjust for:
- Your experience level
- Your location (remote vs. in-office)
- Company size (FAANG vs. startup)
- Cost of living

Example:
Senior React Developer, Remote, 5 YOE

Data points from levels.fyi:
- $130k, $145k, $138k, $152k, $141k, $135k, $148k, $143k, $139k, $150k

Range:
- Low: $135k
- Mid: $142k
- High: $150k

Your target: $145k-155k (aim high)
Your minimum: $135k (walk-away number)
```

### Calculate Your Total Value

```markdown
## Your Compensation Package

### Base Salary
- Your annual pay
- Most important (guaranteed)
- Affects future raises (% based)
- Affects 401k matching
- Affects overtime calculations

### Equity (Stock Options / RSUs)
- Startups: Stock options (might be worth $0)
- Public companies: RSUs (real value)
- Calculate: 
  - Total value / 4 years = annual value
  - Add to base salary for "total comp"

### Bonuses
- Signing bonus (one-time)
- Annual performance bonus (10-20% of base)
- Quarterly bonuses
- Retention bonuses

### Benefits (Monetary Value)
- Health insurance (worth $5k-20k/year)
- 401k match (worth 3-6% of salary)
- PTO days (worth $400-800 per day)
- Learning budget
- Home office stipend
- Commuter benefits
- Gym/wellness stipend

### Perks (Nice but lower priority)
- Free food
- Game room
- Snacks
- Team events

## Total Comp Calculation Example

Offer Letter:
- Base: $120,000
- Signing bonus: $10,000
- RSUs: $40,000 over 4 years = $10k/year
- Annual bonus: 10% target = $12k
- 401k match: 5% = $6k
- Health insurance: $15k value
- PTO: 20 days = $9,200 value

Total Comp Year 1: $120k + $10k + $10k + $12k = $152k
Benefits value: +$30k
True total value: ~$182k

Compare this number, not just base salary.
```

## 🎬 Before the Offer

### Setting the Stage Early

```markdown
## The Salary Question (Round 1)

Recruiter: "What are your salary expectations?"

❌ Bad Answers:
"I'm currently making $100k"
→ You anchored low. Now they won't offer $140k.

"I'll take whatever you offer"
→ You have no leverage.

"I expect $200k"
→ If unrealistic, you're out.

✅ Good Answers:

Option 1: Deflect Early
"I'm focused on finding the right role fit first. 
Once we determine I'm a good match, I'm confident 
we can find a number that works. What's the 
budgeted range for this role?"

Option 2: Give Range (If Pressed)
"Based on my research for this role, location, and 
experience level, I'm seeing $X-Y. I'm flexible 
depending on the full package and growth opportunities. 
What range is allocated for this position?"

Option 3: The Flip
"I'm sure your company pays fairly. What's the 
budgeted range for this position, and we can see 
if we're in the same ballpark?"

Key: Make THEM say a number first.
```

### The "Current Salary" Trap

```markdown
## "What's your current salary?"

This question is now ILLEGAL in many states/cities:
- California
- New York City
- Massachusetts
- Washington
- Colorado
- And growing...

If legal in your area:

❌ Don't say:
"I make $90k"
→ They'll anchor to $95k-100k

✅ Say instead:

Option 1: Deflect
"I'd prefer to focus on the value I can bring to 
this role rather than my current compensation. 
What does your company typically pay for this position?"

Option 2: Total Comp
"My current total compensation including benefits, 
equity, and bonus is in the $X range, but I'm looking 
for a role that offers $Y based on the increased 
responsibilities and market rates."

Option 3: If Remote
"I'm currently at an in-office role with lower 
flexibility. I'm targeting $X for a remote position 
with this scope."

If they insist: Inflate reasonably
- Include: Bonus, equity value, benefits, freelance income
- Add 10-15% for "expected next raise"
```

### Building Leverage

```markdown
## Create Options

The best negotiating position: Having other offers

Timeline:
1-2 months before job search:
- [ ] Update LinkedIn ("Open to opportunities")
- [ ] Apply to 10-20 companies
- [ ] Schedule interviews in batches

Why?
- You're comparing offers, not desperate
- You can play companies against each other
- You walk away if lowballed
- Confidence shows in interviews

The secret:
Even if you want Company A most, interview at B, C, D.
Other offers = negotiating power.

Example:
"I have another offer at $X, but I prefer your company. 
Can you match or get close?"
→ This works. Use it.
```

## 🤝 The Offer Conversation

### When You Receive the Offer

```markdown
## The Phone Call

Recruiter: "We'd like to extend an offer! 
The base salary is $110,000..."

❌ Don't say:
"Wow, yes! I accept!"
"That's lower than I expected..."
"Can you do $140k?" (too fast)

✅ Say:
"Thank you! I'm excited about this opportunity. 
Can you send me the full offer details in writing 
so I can review everything? When do you need a 
response?"

Why:
- Gives you time to think
- Prevents emotional decisions
- Shows you're professional
- They expect this

## Buying Time

Always ask for time:
- They offer: 48 hours
- You request: "Could I have until Friday?" (5-7 days)
- They'll likely say yes

Use this time to:
- Review the numbers
- Get competing offers
- Research the company more
- Prepare your counter
- Consult advisors
```

### Analyzing the Offer

```markdown
## Offer Review Checklist

When you get the written offer, evaluate:

### The Numbers
- [ ] Base salary (compare to research)
- [ ] Signing bonus (one-time or multi-year?)
- [ ] Equity (options or RSUs? Vesting schedule?)
- [ ] Annual bonus (target % and how realistic?)
- [ ] Total comp calculation

### The Terms
- [ ] Start date (is it reasonable?)
- [ ] Location (remote/hybrid/in-office?)
- [ ] Benefits start date (immediately or 90 days?)
- [ ] PTO days (how many? rollover?)
- [ ] Health insurance (premiums and coverage)
- [ ] 401k match (immediate or after 1 year?)

### The Fine Print
- [ ] Non-compete clause (enforceable?)
- [ ] IP assignment (do they own your side projects?)
- [ ] Relocation required? (covered by them?)
- [ ] Probation period (can they fire you easily?)
- [ ] Equity vesting (cliff? 4-year schedule?)

### The Intangibles
- [ ] Growth opportunity
- [ ] Work-life balance
- [ ] Team culture
- [ ] Technology stack
- [ ] Company trajectory

Red flags:
- Below-market salary with no equity
- Aggressive non-compete
- No PTO for first year
- Unclear equity terms
- Pressure to decide immediately
```

## 💪 Negotiation Strategies

### The Negotiation Framework

```markdown
## The 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Express Enthusiasm (CRITICAL)
"I'm really excited about this opportunity and 
the team. I can definitely see myself thriving here."

Why: You want the job. Make that clear first.

### Step 2: Present Your Case
"Based on my research and conversations, I was 
expecting compensation in the $X-Y range. Given 
[specific reasons], I'm hoping we can get closer to $Z."

Why: Data-driven, not emotional. Professional.

### Step 3: Ask Directly
"Is there flexibility in the base salary?"
or
"What can we do to get to $Z?"

Why: Clear ask. Puts ball in their court.

## The Silence Technique

After you make your ask:

🤐 STOP TALKING

The next person who speaks loses.
- They'll fill the silence
- They'll likely make concessions
- Or explain constraints (valuable info)

This is uncomfortable. Do it anyway.
```

### Negotiation Tactics

```markdown
## Tactic 1: The Higher Anchor

When they ask your range:
- Research says: $120k-140k
- You say: $135k-155k (shift up by $15k)

Why: They'll aim for middle of YOUR range.
Result: Likely offer $145k instead of $130k.

## Tactic 2: The Competing Offer

"I have another offer at $X, but I prefer your 
company because [genuine reason]. Can you match 
or get close?"

Rules:
- Must be real (don't lie, you'll get caught)
- Be specific about numbers
- Emphasize you prefer them
- Ask them to match or beat

Success rate: 70%+

## Tactic 3: The Bundle

Don't just ask for salary. Ask for package.

"If base salary is fixed at $X, could we:
- Increase signing bonus to $Y?
- Add extra PTO days?
- Add $Z for home office setup?
- Increase equity grant?
- Accelerate first review to 6 months?"

Why: Gives them options. Easier to say yes to something.

## Tactic 4: The Future Review

If they won't budge:

"I understand the budget constraints. Would you 
be open to a salary review at 6 months instead 
of the standard 12 months, assuming I meet 
performance expectations?"

Why: 
- Shows confidence
- Get raise faster
- They're more likely to say yes (it's later)
- Get it in writing

## Tactic 5: The Specific Number

Don't ask for round numbers.

❌ "Can you do $120,000?"
✅ "Can you do $123,500?"

Why: Specific numbers signal research and precision.
They're more likely to meet specific asks.

## Tactic 6: The Uncomfortable Pause

You: "I was hoping for $135k. Is there flexibility?"
Them: "That's at the top of our range..."

You: [Say nothing. Wait 5 seconds.]

Them: "Let me see what I can do..."

Why: Silence creates pressure. They'll often concede.
```

### Gender Pay Gap Strategies

```markdown
## Research Shows:

Men who negotiate: "Strong, confident"
Women who negotiate: "Aggressive, difficult"

It's unfair. It's real. Adjust strategy accordingly.

## Framing Strategies for Women

❌ Traditional: "I want $X"
→ Can trigger bias

✅ Better: "We want to find a number that works for both of us"
→ Collaborative framing

❌ "I deserve $X"
→ Sounds entitled (unfair, but perception)

✅ "Based on market research and my experience, $X is aligned with similar roles"
→ Objective, data-driven

❌ "Can you do better?"
→ Vague, potentially confrontational

✅ "I'm wondering if there's flexibility in the salary to get us to $X?"
→ Curious, not demanding

## The Buffer Approach

Use an advocate:
- "My mentor reviewed the offer and suggested..."
- "I consulted with a career coach who recommended..."
- "Industry peers have shared that..."

Why: Removes you from direct confrontation while maintaining ask.

## The Positive Approach

Always lead with enthusiasm:
"I'm so excited about this opportunity [SPECIFIC REASON].
I'm hoping we can work together to get to [NUMBER]."

Research shows: Women who combine enthusiasm + ask 
are perceived more positively and get better results.

## 📦 Beyond Base Salary

### The Full Package

```markdown
## If Base Salary Won't Budge

### 1. Signing Bonus
"If we can't adjust the base, would a signing bonus 
of $X be possible?"

Typical: $5k-20k for mid-level, $20k-50k+ for senior
Why companies like it: One-time cost, not recurring

### 2. Equity
"Could we increase the equity grant from X to Y shares?"

For startups: Ask for more options
For public companies: Ask for more RSUs
Calculate: What's it worth per year?

### 3. Earlier Review
"Can we schedule my first performance review at 
6 months instead of 12?"

Why: Get raise faster
Get it in writing!

### 4. Remote Flexibility
"Would it be possible to be fully remote instead 
of hybrid?"

Value: Worth $5k-15k+ (no commute, more time)

### 5. PTO Days
"Could we add 5 additional PTO days?"

Typical: 15-20 days standard
Ask for: 25-30 days
Value: Each day = ~$400-800

### 6. Learning Budget
"Does the company provide a learning/conference budget?"

If no: Ask for $2k-5k annually
If yes: Ask to increase it

### 7. Home Office Stipend
"Would a one-time home office stipend be possible?"

Reasonable ask: $1k-3k
For: Desk, chair, monitor, etc.

### 8. Relocation Assistance
If moving: Ask for:
- Moving costs covered
- Temporary housing
- Travel expenses for house hunting
- Realtor fees
- Typical: $5k-15k

### 9. Title Bump
"I've been functioning at [Senior] level. Would a 
[Senior Engineer] title be possible?"

Why it matters:
- Next job search (experience)
- Internal respect
- Future salary negotiations

### 10. Flexible Hours
"Could I have flexibility to work 10am-6pm instead 
of 9-5?"

Value: Quality of life improvements
```

### The Priority Stack

```markdown
## Negotiate in Order:

Priority 1: Base Salary (affects everything else)
Priority 2: Equity (long-term wealth)
Priority 3: Signing Bonus (immediate cash)
Priority 4: Benefits (PTO, remote work)
Priority 5: Perks (everything else)

Example negotiation:

Round 1: Base salary ($10k increase)
→ If yes: Great! Done.
→ If no: Move to round 2

Round 2: "If base is fixed, how about:"
- Signing bonus of $X?
- Additional equity?
→ If yes: Great! Done.
→ If partial: Move to round 3

Round 3: "Could we also add:"
- 5 extra PTO days?
- Earlier performance review?
→ Get something

Result: You didn't get everything, but you got something.
```

## 🎭 Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Job / Junior Developer

```markdown
## The Situation
- No experience
- No competing offers
- Worried about seeming entitled

## Strategy

Research first:
- Junior dev in your city: $60k-80k
- You were offered: $65k

Your approach:
"Thank you for the offer! I'm excited about the 
opportunity. Based on my research for junior developers 
in [city] with [your skills], I'm seeing ranges of 
$68k-75k. Would there be flexibility to get closer 
to $72k?"

Why this works:
- Shows research (professional)
- Not demanding, asking
- Reasonable ask ($7k bump)
- Still expresses enthusiasm

If they say no:
"I understand. Would it be possible to:
- Review salary at 6 months?
- Add a $5k signing bonus?
- Start with an extra week of PTO?"

Walk away with something.
```

### Scenario 2: Mid-Level with Competing Offers

```markdown
## The Situation
- 3-5 years experience
- Two offers:
  - Company A: $120k (you prefer)
  - Company B: $135k

## Strategy

To Company A:
"I'm very excited about joining [Company A] because 
[specific reason - team, tech, mission]. 

I've received another offer at $135k base, but I 
genuinely prefer your company and the opportunity 
to work on [specific project/tech].

Is there flexibility to match or get closer to that 
number? I'd love to make this work."

Possible outcomes:

Best case: They match $135k
Good case: They offer $128k-130k
Okay case: They offer $125k + signing bonus
Worst case: They can't budge

If worst case:
"I understand budget constraints. Would you consider:
- Earlier review at 6 months?
- Additional equity?
- Extra PTO days?"

Final decision: 
$120k at dream company vs. $135k at okay company?
Money isn't everything (but it is something).
```

### Scenario 3: Senior Developer, Lowball Offer

```markdown
## The Situation
- 7+ years experience
- Market rate: $150k-170k
- Offer: $130k

## Strategy

This is a RED FLAG. But let's try:

"Thank you for the offer. I'm enthusiastic about 
the role and the challenges ahead.

However, I need to be transparent: based on my 
experience level and market research for senior 
developers with my skill set, the offer is below 
market rate by $20k-30k.

I'm seeing ranges of $150k-170k for similar roles. 
I'd need to be at least $145k to make this work. 
Is there flexibility here?"

Possible responses:

Them: "We can't go that high, but how about $138k?"
→ Still low. Push again: "Could we meet at $142k?"

Them: "Budget is fixed at $130k, but we have equity..."
→ "How much equity, and what's the vesting schedule?"
→ Calculate if equity makes up difference

Them: "That's the best we can do."
→ Walk away. Seriously. They're undervaluing you.

Red flag: If a company lowballs by 20%+, it shows:
- They don't value senior talent
- Likely underpay across the board
- You'll have same fight for raises
- Culture issue
```

### Scenario 4: Internal Promotion

```markdown
## The Situation
- Been at company 2 years
- Promoted from Mid to Senior
- Offered 10% raise ($110k → $121k)
- Market rate for Senior: $140k

## Strategy

"Thank you for the promotion! I'm excited to take 
on senior-level responsibilities.

I've done some research on senior developer compensation, 
and I'm seeing ranges of $135k-145k in our market. 

Given that I've been:
- [Specific achievement 1]
- [Specific achievement 2]
- [Specific achievement 3]

Would it be possible to adjust the salary to $135k 
to align with market rates for this level?"

Why this works:
- Acknowledges promotion
- Data-backed
- Proves value (specific achievements)
- Reasonable ask

If they say no:
"Could we revisit at 6 months with clear metrics?"
→ Get metrics in writing
→ Follow up in 6 months with proof

Pro tip: 
Internal promotions often underpay vs. external hires.
If they won't budge, consider switching companies.
External move often = 20-30% raise.
```

### Scenario 5: Counter-Offer (Trying to Leave)

```markdown
## The Situation
- You resign
- Current company counter-offers with big raise
- Should you stay?

## Analysis

❌ Usually a bad idea to accept:

Statistics:
- 80% who accept counter-offers leave within 6 months
- 90% leave within 12 months

Why:
- They only raised salary when forced
- Shows they were underpaying you
- Trust is broken
- You're seen as flight risk
- First to be cut if layoffs come
- You burned bridge with new company

✅ When to consider:

Only if:
- Nothing else was wrong (you were leaving only for money)
- They give 25%+ raise (not just matching offer)
- Promotion to new level
- Change in responsibilities
- Put everything in writing

## How to Handle

Them: "We'll match your new offer! $140k!"
(When you were making $105k)

You: "I appreciate that, but this isn't just about 
compensation. I'm excited about [new opportunity] 
because [growth, tech, team, mission].

If compensation had been discussed earlier, we might 
have been able to address this. I'm committed to 
moving forward."

Stay strong. Move on.
```

## 💬 Negotiation Scripts

### Script 1: The Standard Negotiation

```text
[After receiving offer]

"Thank you so much for the offer! I'm really excited 
about this opportunity and the team. I think I could 
make a real impact on [specific project or initiative].

I've taken some time to review the offer details, and 
I'd like to discuss the compensation. Based on my 
research for this role, location, and my experience 
level, I was expecting a base salary in the $X-Y range.

Given [specific value you bring - skills, experience, 
unique background], I'm hoping we can adjust the base 
salary to $Z. Is there flexibility here?"

[SILENCE - let them respond]

If they push back:
"I understand. If the base salary is fixed, would it 
be possible to [adjust signing bonus / increase equity / 
add PTO days / earlier review]?"
```

### Script 2: With Competing Offer

```text
"Thank you for the offer. I'm genuinely excited about 
[Company] because [specific reason - be genuine].

I want to be transparent: I've received another offer 
at $X, which is [Y amount] higher than your current 
offer. However, your company is my top choice because 
[specific reasons].

Is there any flexibility to match or get closer to 
that number? I really want to make this work."

[SILENCE]

If they ask for proof:
"I'm happy to provide the offer letter if that helps."
(Have it ready)
```

### Script 3: Low Offer, Need to Push Back

```text
"Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the time you've 
invested in the process.

I need to be transparent: the offer is below what I 
was expecting based on my research and conversations. 
For this role and experience level, I'm seeing market 
rates of $X-Y.

The gap is significant enough that I'd need to be at 
least $Z to move forward. I'm very interested in the 
role - is this something we can work toward?"

[SILENCE]

Their response tells you everything:
- Quick yes → Great!
- "Let me check" → Good sign
- Defensive/rigid → Red flag
```

### Script 4: If They Say "That's the Max"

```text
"I understand there are budget constraints. I appreciate 
your transparency.

If the base salary is fixed at $X, would you be open 
to discussing:

1. A signing bonus of $Y to bridge the gap?
2. An accelerated review timeline (6 months instead of 12)?
3. Additional equity?
4. Extra PTO days?

I'm flexible on how we structure this - I just want 
to ensure the total package is aligned with the value 
I'm bringing."

[Pick 2-3 asks, prioritize them]
```

### Script 5: Declining an Offer (Professionally)

```text
"Thank you so much for the offer and the time you've 
invested in the process. I really enjoyed learning 
about [Company] and meeting the team.

After careful consideration, I've decided to pursue 
another opportunity that's a better fit for my career 
goals at this time.

I hope we can stay in touch, and I'd love to reconnect 
in the future.

Thank you again for your time and consideration."

[Keep it short, professional, no need to explain in detail]

Email template:

"Hi [Name],

Thank you so much for the offer and for the time you 
and the team invested in the interview process. I 
really enjoyed learning about [Company] and the 
opportunity to work on [specific project].

After careful consideration, I've decided to pursue

## 🎓 Advanced Strategies

### The Executive Negotiation

```markdown
## Senior/Staff+ Levels ($200k+ total comp)

At this level, negotiation is expected and complex:

### Components to Negotiate

1. **Base Salary** ($150k-300k+)
2. **Equity** (significant RSUs/options)
3. **Signing Bonus** ($25k-100k+)
4. **Annual Bonus** (20-50% of base)
5. **Retention Bonus** (multi-year)
6. **Severance Terms** (if let go)
7. **Relocation Package** ($20k-50k+)
8. **Title & Scope** (Staff/Principal/etc.)

### Strategy

Don't negotiate piecemeal. Negotiate package:

"I'm excited about the opportunity. Looking at the 
total package, I was expecting $X in total comp 
(base + equity + bonus). Can we structure the offer 
to hit that number? I'm flexible on how we allocate 
it across components."

Get lawyer to review:
- Employment contract
- Equity agreements
- Non-compete clauses
- Cost: $500-2000, worth it at this level
```

### The Startup Negotiation

```markdown
## Equity-Heavy Offers

Startup offers: Lower base, higher equity

Example:
- Big Tech: $180k base, $50k RSUs = $230k total
- Startup: $140k base, $200k options = $340k total*
  (*if startup succeeds - big IF)

### Questions to Ask

About the company:
- How much runway? (12+ months ideal)
- Latest valuation? ($X million)
- How many employees? (team size)
- Revenue? (is it real?)
- Path to profitability?

About equity:
- Number of shares granted?
- Total outstanding shares? (calculate %)
- Current share price?
- Preferred or common stock?
- Vesting schedule? (4 years, 1 year cliff?)
- Exercise window if you leave? (90 days standard)
- Single or double-trigger acceleration? (if acquired)

### Calculate Equity Value

Current valuation: $50M
Outstanding shares: 10M
Your options: 50,000 (0.5%)

Current value: $250k (50k * $5/share)
But: Startups are illiquid
Discount by 50-75% for risk

Real value: $62k-125k

Ask yourself: 
If options are worth $0, is base salary acceptable?
If not, negotiate base higher.

### Negotiation Strategy

"I'm excited about the mission and the team. Given 
the risk profile of a startup, I'd need either:

Option A: Base salary of $X (closer to market rate)
Option B: Current base with Y% equity (increase grant)

I believe in what we're building, but want to ensure 
I can manage the financial risk. Which option works 
better for the company?"
```
